This fight took place on the undercard of the Pacquiao vs. Algieri on HBO PPV bout on November 22, 2014 at the Cotai Arena, Venetian Resort in Macao. Although Piritapinyo's record of 52 wins and 1 loss made the fight sound challenging for Lomachenko, the only time he stepped up in his 11-year career was in 2012 against Chris John, which he lost via unanimous decision.[42] Lomachenko handled his opponent easily, hurting him a few times and scoring a knockdown at the end of the fourth round. In the seventh round, Lomachenko stopped using his left hand; it was later confirmed that he injured that hand. Lomachenko won a unanimous decision with the scores of 120–107 on all three of the judges' scorecards.[43][44] Lomachenko landed 368 of 1006 punches thrown (37%) and Piriyapinyo landed 94 of his 501 thrown (19%).[45]`,\r\n    Profile: `Following a third successful defense, Lomachenko, still the reigning WBO featherweight champion decided to move up weight to super featherweight to challenge Román 'Rocky' Martínez (29-2-3, 17 KOs) for his WBO super featherweight title on 11 June 2016 at the Madison Square Garden Theater. Martinez was coming off a draw against Orlando Salido in September 2015, after he controversially defeated him in their first fight in April 2015 for the WBO title.[54] Lomachenko became the fastest boxer to win a world title in two weight divisions knocking out Martinez in the 5th round of the world title fight. Lomachenko dominated the fight from the start with superior footwork, hand speed and slick punching from different angles. According to CompuBox, Lomachenko out-landed Martinez 87 to 34. After the fight, Lomachenko called out Orlando Salido, \"Hey Salido, I'm ready to fight you at any time, before the Vargas fight, I told him to win the fight but I never told him I wasn't going to fight him if he didn't, so let's do it. I want to revenge Salido for my fans and give them a win over him.\"[55] Lomachenko was paid $850,000 for the bout, at the time a career-high purse.[26]`,\r\n    Contacts: `Lomachenko faced fellow 2012 Olympic gold medallist Luke Campbell on 31 August 2019, at The O2 Arena in London. Lomachenko retained the WBA, WBO and The Ring lightweight titles, and gained the vacant WBC lightweight title by defeating Campbell by unanimous decision.[138] He was in fine form, winning by 119-108 on two judges' cards, and 118-109 on the other. Despite being a heavy underdog, Campbell started well and took the first round. Lomachenko soon found his groove, however, and almost had Campbell down in the 5th round but for the bell. Campbell took more shots in round 6, but fired back and the fight remained competitive. Lomachenko knocked down Campbell in the 11th round after a series of body shots followed by a stiff jab. Campbell beat the count, and ultimately survived the round and the fight, receiving credit after the bout for his resilience.[139] In his in-ring interview, Lomachenko called for a lightweight unification fight with the winner of Richard Commey vs. Teófimo López, who will contest for the IBF title in December.[139][140]`\r\n}","import React from 'react'\r\nimport { Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'\r\nimport tabsContent from './tabsContent'\r\nimport './Tabs.css'\r\n\r\nexport default class Tabs extends React.Component {\r\n    state = {\r\n        tabs: [\r\n            { id: 'tab-1', title: 'Home', content: tabsContent.Home },\r\n            { id: 'tab-2', title: 'Profile', content: tabsContent.Profile },\r\n            { id: 'tab-3', title: 'Contacts', content: tabsContent.Contacts },\r\n        ],\r\n        currentTab: null\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    handleClick = event => {\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            currentTab: event.target.innerText\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        const { location } = this.props\r\n        const { tabs, currentTab } = this.state\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n            <>\r\n                <h1>Tabs</h1>\r\n                <button className=\"btn\">\r\n                    <Link to=\"/\">Home</Link>\r\n                </button>\r\n                <br /><br />\r\n                {tabs.map(tab => (\r\n                    <NavLink\r\n                        key={tab.id}\r\n                        onClick={this.handleClick}\r\n                        to={{\r\n                            pathname: '/tabs',\r\n                            hash: `/${tab.title}`\r\n                        }}\r\n                        exact\r\n                        className=\"tab\"\r\n                        activeClassName={location.hash === `#/${tab.title}` ?
